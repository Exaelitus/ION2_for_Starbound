Item Organizer Network 2 (ION2) provides one new item, <i>"Pharitu ION Device"</i> which can be purchased at the <b>Infinity Express in the Outpost</b>.

Place the item on the wall closest to a storage container that you want to use as a "loot dump".  When activated, this device will scan that storage container, and then organize/sort the contents into other storage containers nearby.

( It is best if there are no storage containers that are as near to the device as your "loot dump" container.  It is a lost prototype of the Pharitu precursors afterall! )


Steam Mod ID: 2182045406
Version: 1.00
	

	
Compatibility / Issues :
-----------------------
	
	- No known issues.
	
	- Multiplayer, if every client/server has it installed.
	- Confirmed works with Starbound client 1.4.4
	
	- For some elaborate bases or large storage areas with many containers, it is recommended to have a computer that vastly exceeds the "Recommended" specs for Starbound found on its Steam store page.   Starbound isn't very optimized, even in the best conditions it may lag in some cases.
	- If you are experiencing ANY issues you feel is a bug, please try to repoduce the bug without other Mods active first.  It may not be this mod, or it may be a conflict between two or more of them.  If it still reproduces, please report the problem in the "Issues" discussion area.

	- Compatible with Enhanced Storage
	- Compatible with Frackin Universe
